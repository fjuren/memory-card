# Memory card game

A mini project following The Odin Project curriculum. The purpose of this project is to put my understanding of React concepts into practice, including states, props, and componenet lifecycles and hooks; namely functional component's hooks useState and useEffect. 

One thing I really enjoyed trying out in the project was using the [fisher-yates shuffle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)! 

Have fun playing this [memory game](https://fjuren.github.io/memory-card/) that uses characters from Mario.
